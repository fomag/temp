<h2 id="h1">Before preparing income tax returns</h2>
<p>There are several steps for preparing tax returns. To ensure you have everything you need, we recommend you follow these guidelines:&nbsp;</p>

    





<h3>Registration reminders</h3>
                    


    
    <p>Before you prepare income tax returns, you must be affiliated with an organization. Your <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> coordinator may be able to help you find one. You must also:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Register as a <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteer (annual registration).
</li>
<li>Register for EFILE, to electronically file tax returns (initial registration or annual renewal).
</li>
<li>Obtain a RepID (one-time registration for Auto-fill my return).
</li>
<li>Obtain a police records check (PRC) if you:
<ul class="square">
<li>will be filing paper returns</li>
<li>plan to use Auto-fill my return</li>
<li>will have access to taxpayer information</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, please refer to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/volunteer.html" target="_blank">Register to volunteer</a>.</p>

<p>If you are working on a computer that is also used by other volunteers within the same community organization, you must open the <strong>EFILE-NetFile setup</strong> and ensure that <strong>your</strong> EFILE number, password and <abbr title="CVITP Organization Identification Number">COIN</abbr> (if available) are entered correctly <strong>before completing any tax returns.</strong></p>
    
    
		
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <h3 class="h4">Note</h3>
<p>Your organization will receive a <strong><abbr title="Community Income Tax Volunteer Program">CVITP</abbr> Organization Identification Number</strong> (COIN) in their registration approval letter. </p>
  <p>The <strong><abbr title="CVITP Organization Identification Number">COIN</abbr></strong> is a unique and permanent, eight-digit identification number. It will remain unchanged for your organization every year, even if your organization takes a break from participating in the <abbr title="Community Income Tax Volunteer Program">CVITP</abbr>.</p>
  <p>Your organization is responsible for sharing the <abbr title="CVITP Organization Identification Number">COIN</abbr> with volunteers <strong>and</strong> ensuring it is entered into the appropriate field of UFile <abbr title="Community Income Tax Volunteer Program">CVITP</abbr>.</p>
  <ul class="mrgn-tp-md lst-spcd">
<li>If a <abbr title="CVITP Organization Identification Number">COIN</abbr> has not been entered, the software will prompt you to enter a <abbr title="CVITP Organization Identification Number">COIN</abbr> before you can transmit. </li>

<p>A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document giving one person the power to act on behalf of another person. <abbr title="Power of attorney">POA</abbr> can be granted to act on behalf of an individual specifically for property and finances, specifically for health or personal care decisions, or for both. It is important to ensure that the individual has the correct authority before proceeding. If an individual indicates that they have <abbr title="Power of attorney">POA</abbr> for someone, but they do not have the legal documentation on hand, contact the dedicated help line for volunteers. The individual will need to speak with a telephone agent to answer confidentiality questions. Once confidentiality screening is met, the agent will confirm if the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has a record of the <abbr title="Power of attorney">POA</abbr> on file.

    <h3>Step 1 of 2 - Completing form TIS60</h3>
<p>Section I</p>
<p>Before you start preparing the return, <strong>Section I – Authorization</strong> needs to be completed and signed. By signing the TIS60, the individual consents to having their tax return prepared by a <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteer. A TIS60 must be signed for <strong>each</strong> tax return being completed by a volunteer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Part A – Identification</strong> identifies the individual</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Part B – Disclaimer</strong>, the individual acknowledges with their signature that their tax return is being prepared by a volunteer. The individual whose information is in Part A must sign Part B. However, Part B can be signed by a legal representative, on the individual’s behalf, provided they have the authorization to do so. More information on this can be found in the <a href="#poa">Important note for <abbr title="Power of attorney">POA</abbr></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Section II</p>
<p>Section II of form TIS60 is <strong>only applicable</strong> if the return will be electronically filed (EFILED), and instructions for completing this section can be found later on this page under <a href="#sst">Completing Section II of form TIS60.</a></p>

    <h3>Step 2 of 2 - Completing form TIS60</h3>
<p>If the return is being electronically filed, both the volunteer and the individual must complete <strong>Section II</strong>.
</p><ul class="lst-spcd">
<li><strong>Part C – Declaration</strong>, the volunteer must record the total and taxable income amounts, total federal non-refundable tax credits, and if applicable, the refund or balance owing from the completed tax return
</li>
<li><strong>Part D – Declaration and authorization</strong>, by signing, the individual acknowledges that they have reviewed the information from Part A (Identification), and Part C (Declaration) and that the information provided is correct. The individual’s signature also authorizes the volunteer to electronically file the tax return. Part D can be signed by a legal representative, on the individual’s behalf, provided they have the authorization to do so. More information on this can be found in the <a href="#poa">Important note for <abbr title="Power of attorney">POA</abbr></a>
</li>
<li><strong>Part E – Electronic filer identification</strong>, the volunteer must record their name and EFILE number
</li>
<li><strong>Part F&nbsp;–</strong> a <strong>Document control number</strong>, is generated upon EFILE transmission and must be recorded by the volunteer
</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info mrgn-tp-0" id="dcn">
<h4>Note</h4>

<p>The <strong>Document control number</strong> (DCN) is assigned to the tax return at the time of transmission and acts as an identifier for that return while it is being processed by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. It can also be assigned to a tax return the first time it is saved.

<div class="alert alert-info mrgn-tp-0">
 <h4>Remember</h4>

        <p>Individuals may ask to make an adjustment to their tax return, as a <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteer you are not expected to assist with adjustments. However, if you choose to do so the individual must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>their notice of assessment for the tax year requiring the adjustment;</li>
<li>a copy of their tax return with all amounts reported;</li>
<li>any receipts or tax slips supporting the adjustment. </li>
</ul>
<p>To request a change the individual must complete, sign and date form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1-adj.html" target="_blank">T1-ADJ, Adjustment request</a>. Volunteers can choose to assist the individual but cannot act as their representative. Instructions on how to complete form T1-ADJ can be found on the back of the form.</p>
<p>Generally, a change can be made to a return for a tax year ending in any of the ten previous calendar years. For example, a request made in 2021 must relate to the 2011 or a later tax year to be considered.</p>
<section class="alert alert-warning">
  <h3>Important note</h3>
<p>An individual must wait to receive their notice of assessment for the tax year needing a change before requesting the adjustment.</p>
</section>
<section class="alert alert-info">
  <h3>Note</h3>
<p>The individual can expect delays of 10 to 12 weeks on processing paper T1 adjustments.  </p>

<p>If an individual returns to the organization with follow-up questions about their return, please refer them to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s Individual tax enquiries line, <span class="nowrap">1-800-959-8281</span>.</p>
